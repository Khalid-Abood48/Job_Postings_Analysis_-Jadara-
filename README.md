https://khalid-abood48-use-case-5-app-v8mwf7.streamlit.app/

**Overview**
This project aims to analyze the employment landscape across different regions in Saudi Arabia. It focuses on understanding the distribution of job postings, exploring any gender preferences in these listings, analyzing salary ranges, and the opportunities available for both fresh graduates and experienced professionals.

**Steps in the Project**
**Step 1:** Defining the Problem Statement
The initial phase involves outlining the key questions to be addressed about the employment landscape in Saudi Arabia:

Regional distribution of job postings
Presence of gender preferences in job postings
Expected salary ranges
Opportunities for fresh graduates versus experienced professionals

**Step 2:** Collecting Data
Data is sourced from Jadara, containing comprehensive job postings within Saudi Arabia.

**Step 3:** Data Quality Checking and Remediation
This step ensures the integrity of the data by checking for inconsistencies or missing values and applying necessary corrections.

**Step 4:** Exploratory Data Analysis
An in-depth analysis is conducted to uncover trends and patterns in the employment data.

**Step 5-9:** Building Models, Evaluation, Communication, Deployment, and Maintenance
These steps are marked as not applicable for this project as the primary focus is on data analysis rather than model building and deployment.

**Tools and Technologies**
Python for data manipulation and analysis
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive code execution and data exploration
Running the Project
To run the analysis, ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) loaded. Clone the project, navigate to the project directory, and run the Jupyter Notebook.
